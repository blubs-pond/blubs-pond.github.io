# Ren'Py to Web Migration To-Do List

This list outlines the key tasks required to migrate the game from Ren'Py to a dynamic web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, hosted as a subpage on `blubs-pond.github.io`.

## Phase 1: Setup and Core Structure

- [ ] **Create a new folder for the game within your `blubs-pond.github.io` repository (e.g., `reactor-game/`).**
- [ ] Create the basic project structure within the game folder:
    - `index.html` (main game page)
    - `style.css` (for styling)
    - `script.js` (main game logic)
    - Folders for assets (images, audio)
- [ ] Set up a basic HTML layout in `index.html` with containers for game elements (background, character sprites, dialogue box, choices, UI elements).
- [ ] Apply basic CSS styling in `style.css` to the layout.
- [ ] Create a simple JavaScript file (`script.js`) that loads and runs a basic function to confirm the setup is working.
- [ ] **Ensure all file paths within your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are relative to the game folder (e.g., `/reactor-game/style.css`, `/reactor-game/assets/background.png`).**
- [ ] (Optional but Recommended) Research and choose a JavaScript game development framework (e.g., Phaser, PixiJS) and set it up in the project.

## Phase 2: Core Visual Novel Elements

... (The rest of the tasks remain the same)

## Phase 6: Testing and Deployment

... (The testing remains the same)
- [ ] Commit your changes to the `blubs-pond.github.io` repository.
- [ ] **Verify that the game is accessible at `https://blubs-pond.github.io/reactor-game/`.**
- [ ] Test the deployed game on GitHub Pages.
